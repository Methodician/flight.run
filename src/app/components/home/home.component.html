				<h1>WHO WE ARE | WHAT WE DO</h1>
				<p>A boutique web development and design agency offering startup and entrepreneurial consulting</p>
				<p>... breathe life into your dream ...</p>
				<!-- <p>... at your service ...</p> -->
				<p>We're mastering the art of the MVP; honing in on the optimal combo of lean startup best practices, agile development
					methodologies, and awesome sauce. Our baseline tech stack (combination of tools and technologies used to create software)
					allows for affordable, rapid prototyping without sacrificing the potential to be scaled and transitioned into enterprise-scale
					architecture. That means we can leverage all the code and work we did to launch your MVP without starting from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>If you have a great idea, entrepreneurial drive, and access to resources but you're having trouble formulating your first
					moves or getting "off the ground", we can help!
				</p>
				<p>If you've had your dream project on the back burner because you're just not sure, consider a free concept validation
					session. I can't ensure your idea will work, but I can usually tell if something has no chance.
				</p>
				<p>We also provide a full suite of branding, custom graphics and icons, and professional web design. You can order them
					as sides, appetizers, or as a core element of our primary engineering services.

							"Finding Flight has changed my life!!! For ten years, I struggled to create a company to make the world's building information
							easy to access. I researched markets, developed business plans, theorized algorithms, studied data science and privacies,
							toyed with geospatials - the works! This was all very exciting for me, but while I had great friends, advisors, family,
							I was really struggling alone. What I needed was to "take Flight"! What I needed was a team of local folks with the
							skills to build what I wanted built - to meet with me, listen to me, validate that which was good, propose ways to
							improve, propose labor hours to meet requirements, and execute as promised. On this flight, I can select from all
							of the above... and MORE!!! I hope to never land!!!!! Compehensive front AND back end application engineering, design,
							deployment and support? Check! Geospatial algorithmic securitization support? Check!! Creative drive, pride in work?
							Check!!! Business acumen, professionalism? Check!!!!"
