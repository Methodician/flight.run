					We're mastering the art of the MVP. Honing in on the optimal combo of lean startup best practices and agile development methodologies.
					Our baseline tech stack allows for affordable, rapid prototyping but can be scaled and transitioned into massive, enterprise
					architecture. That means your MVP doesn't have to be scrapped if you go viral and you've already got a solid team familiar
					with your codebase!
				</p>

				<p class="tagline">We work with entrepreneurs and idea people to bring their ideas to fruition.</p>

				<p class="description">
					Entrepreneurs need their startup idea to be viable, not just minimal. And it's the idea and the business that need to be
					viable, not just the product. We define a viable state as meeting one or more of the following three criteria:
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-md-4 col-xl-4 icon-group">
						<div class="icon-text">
							<h3>Meteoric Takeoff</h3>
							<p class="italic">Rapid mass-market adoption of a new product or service.</p>
							<p>
								Usually best suited for low-margin, mass-market ideas. Your ultimate goal is to have lots of customers and deep market penetration.
								In this case it can be a good idea to lose money early on. Give something away to attract early adopters. A rapid
								rise in early adoption could be your ticket. This could create a monetization opportunity, or just look really good
								to investors there by making you more presentation ready.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-4 col-xl-4 icon-group">
						<div class="icon-text">
							<h3>Cash Flow Positive</h3>
							<p class="italic">More money is generated by the product than it consumes.</p>
							<p>
								It can be surprisingly easy to get here in the right context. This approach is usually best suited for sales-heavy, high-margin
								products or services (usually B2B) where one big customer could net you thousands of dollars per month. At the outset
								this allows you to reinvest and grow but it also looks really good to investors, making your product or service more
								presentation ready.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-4 col-xl-4 icon-group">
						<div class="icon-text">
							<h3>Presentation Ready</h3>
							<p class="italic">The product or idea is compelling investors and early adopters.</p>
							<p>
								You can get here without the other two, but realistically most investors these days won't give you the time of day unless
								you have something to show and some skin in the game. I don't think every software startup should be focused on that
								big investment or aquihire but if they are, they'll need more than a good idea, some fancy slides, and a sparkling
								smile to get it.

							I was really struggling alone. What I needed was to "take Flight"! What I needed was a team of local folks with the
							skills to build what I wanted built - to meet with me, listen to me, validate that which was good, propose ways to
							improve, propose labor hours to meet requirements, and execute as promised. On this flight, I can select from all
							of the above... and MORE!!! I hope to never land!!!!! Compehensive front AND back end application engineering, design,
