						<h3>Validation</h3>

			<h1>What we're about...</h1>
			<p>At Flight, we're mastering the art of the MVP. We're honing in on the optimal combo of lean startup best practices, agile development methodologies, and awesome sauce. We've assembled a tech stack (combination of tools and technologies used to create software) which allows for affordable rapid prototyping that can be scaled and transitioned into enterprise-scale services without starting from scratch. That means we can leverage all the code and work we did to launch your MVP while we're building and scaling your next-big-thing.
			</p>
			<p>If you have a great idea, entrepreneurial drive, and access to resources but you're having trouble formulating your first moves or getting "off the ground", we can help!
			</p>
			<p>If you've had your dream project on the back burner because you're just not sure, consider a free concept validation session. I can't ensure your idea will work, but I can usually tell if something has no chance.
			</p>
			<p>We also provide a full suite of branding, custom graphics and icons, and professional web design. You can order them as sides, appetizers, or as a core element of our primary engineering services.
