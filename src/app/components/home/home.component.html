				<!-- <p>... at your service ...</p> -->
				<p>
					We're mastering the art of the MVP; honing in on the optimal combo of lean startup best practices, agile development methodologies,
					and awesome sauce. Our baseline tech stack allows for affordable, rapid prototyping but can be scaled and transitioned
					into massive, enterprise architecture. That means your MVP doesn't have to be scrapped if you go viral.
				</p>

				<h2>scenario:</h2>

				<p>
					You have a great idea. You have entrepreneurial drive. Ideally, you have access to resources. For whatever reason, you're
					struggling to formulate your first moves and get "off the ground" but we can help!
				</p>

				<h2>scenario:</h2>

				<p>
					You've had your dream project on the back burner for years. You've started, you've stopped, and you've started. For whatever
					reason, liftoff hasn't occurred. We can help!
				</p>

				<h2>awesome:</h2>

				<p>
					Take advantage of our technical expertise and business acumen. We can assemble a suite of tools and technologies that will
					put you strides ahead of incombents or competition. We can guide you around landmines and into goldmines. You'd be forgiven
					for believing we can do magic.
				</p>

				<p>
					Consider a
					<i>free</i> concept validation session. Nobody can ensure your idea will work but we can usually pinpoint the weak links.
					We can identify the fulcrum, the leverage points, and the pivots. We can put you on a path to success or steer you away
					from the cliff.
				</p>

				<p>
					We also provide a full suite of branding, custom graphics and icons, and professional web design. You can order them as sides,
					appetizers, or as a core element of our primary engineering services.

							toyed with geospatials - the works! This was all very exciting for me, but while I had great friends, advisors, family,
							I was really struggling alone. What I needed was to "take Flight"! What I needed was a team of local folks with the
							skills to build what I wanted built - to meet with me, listen to me, validate that which was good, propose ways to
							improve, propose labor hours to meet requirements, and execute as promised. On this flight, I can select from all
							of the above... and MORE!!! I hope to never land!!!!! Compehensive front AND back end application engineering, design,
							deployment and support? Check! Geospatial algorithmic securitization support? Check!! Creative drive, pride in work?
							Check!!! Business acumen, professionalism? Check!!!!"
